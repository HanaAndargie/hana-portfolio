          I&apos;m Hana A. Kassie, an Electrical &amp; Computer Engineer and
          front-end developer from Ethiopia. My passion for technology began
          early, and over the past three years, I&apos;ve focused on blending my
          engineering expertise with my love for creating user-focused
          applications. I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it&apos;s
          designing intuitive interfaces or exploring advanced computing
          concepts. As an engineer, I&apos;ve worked on projects involving
          autonomous systems, deep learning, and human-computer interaction,
          applying cutting-edge technologies to real-world challenges. On the
          front-end, I specialize in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind
          CSS, building dynamic, responsive applications, and have experience
          with back-end technologies like Nest.js and Prisma for full-stack
          development. What excites me most is the intersection of engineering
          and software developmentâ€”leveraging technical knowledge to create
          innovative, scalable solutions, whether optimizing algorithms for
          robots or designing seamless web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to opportunities where I can bring my diverse skills to
          the table, contribute to impactful projects, and continue to grow as a
          professional. If you&apos;re looking for someone who&apos;s passionate
          about blending engineering and front-end development, I&apos;d love to
          hear from you!
